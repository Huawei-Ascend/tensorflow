> The TF_Adapter plug-in has a strict matching relationship with Tensorflow. Before building from source code, you need to ensure that it has been installed correctly [Tensorflow v1.15.0
>版本](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) 。

You may also build GraphEngine from source. To build GraphEngine, please make sure that you have access to an Ascend 910 environment as compiling environment, and make sure that following software requirements are fulfilled.
- Linux OS
- GCC >= 7.3.0
- CMake >= 3.14.0
- [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/download.html)

#### Download
```
git clone https://github.com/Huawei-Ascend/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
```

#### Execute script to generate installation package
```
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```


After the script is successfully executed, a compressed file of tfadapter.tar will be generated in the output directory

#### Install
Unzip the tfadapter.tar file to generate npu_bridge-1.15.0-py3-none-any.whl,
After you can install the TF_Adapter plug-in using pip.
```
pip install ./dist/python/dist/npu_bridge-1.15.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
